            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>Gabriel "Gab" Berthelot was born on the Watcher's Isle into an insular fold of pirates bonded to an eldritch sea deity known as Xeheia the Fury. Intended to be raised as the fold's next patriarch, he was fed a substance shortly after birth that bonded him more closely to Xeheia than most, and gifted him supernatural command of sea and storm.</p>

            <p>Gab served as first mate on Xeheia's flagship, the <em>Screaming Squall</em>, under captain <a href="#hugo">Hugo Melan√ßon</a>. They clashed regularly, sometimes due to the unusual power heirarchy between them, but mostly because of Hugo's controlling and secretive nature and Gab's reflexive insubordination.

            <h3>Personality</h3>

            <p>Gab is brash and loud, quick to laugh, charming (when he wants to be), and despite his career as a pirate, is honest to a fault about what he has to say. He has an explosive temper but is just as quick to calm down. He doesn't hold a grudge for long, but is inclined to sulk when he feels slighted. He absolutely refuses to wear:
